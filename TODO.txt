Data 2 Setembro
	- see email:
	Francois
		- javascript mongodb - ok
			fazer o exemplo de bash em js
		- mutual exclusion: entender, aplicar em um exemplo com python, fazer um exemplo

		- analisar com trace compare ambos os testes
		- achar mais problemas
		- implementar outro problema: reading from disk with php
		
	- fork x pthreads x pth
		portable threads

	- paraver
	- reading about trace correlation - master thesis
	- frances
Data 3 de Setembro
		- Finalizacao de exercicios trace compare	
		- strace
Data 4 de Setembro
	- regular meeting - progess meeting
	- Reading again the article of francois
	
	- reading about trace correlation, since it is pointed "Comparison of system call traces recorded on different operating systems has been used to detect intrusions. Since some variations are inherent to the use of different operating systems, the authors transform low-level events into higher-level concepts to allow a meaningful comparison. Their algorithm computes a correlation score for two traces, but doesnt show individual differences. Also, it doesnt take timing into account"
	- Leitura: State History Tree: an Incremental disk-based structure for very large interval data	
	- Leitura Thesis of Trace Correlation
	- 
Data 5 de Setembro
	- Negociar com banco - ok
	- Final de Leitura - Trace Correlation
	- Ler Performance Debugging in the Large via Mining millions of Stack Traces
	- Summary of Papers - ok doing
		
		TraceDiff
			Gosma tool
			It is a visualization and mining tool for traces, which provides according to the authors: scalabilitym robustness and ease to use. This can show different metrics but the main one is to show strong and weak similarity bettwen function calls
						
		IntroPerf
		
		perf to call stack
		
		libundwind: tests with perf
			
	- http://www.tele-task.de/archive/series/overview/883
	- Fazer backup docs - ok
	- Completar um pouco do PhD escrito - ok
	- 
	- Lttng-simple understanding
	
	
Data 6 de Setembro:
	- chegar cedo!! - ok
	- Ler: Article 1:  Efficient Methods for trace analysis parallelization
		
	- 9 mostrar trampos pro Francis - cheguei 9h30
	
	- Do more tests with TraceCompare		
	- Do tests with perf and libunwind
	- Trace Compass example of State History Tree
		> generate them with trace compass

	- re-do the implementation with python and CFT
		
	- Apresentacao Chefe - tenso
		Muito legal, muito legal mesmo =D
			Sai com uma pergunta: 
			Quais partes de um programa sao as mais rapidas caso executado duas vezes? E caso executado n vezes, com pequenas mudancas?

				GNU super optimizer
				achar os hot spots que gastem mais/menos tempo ->
				What is the 
				Find correlation patter bettween the runs?
				Keep track of the samples so you can track the fast
				fazer as alteracoes em paralelo para ser mais rapido
				
	SuperOtimization	
			What is it?
			Superoptimization is the task of finding the optimal code sequence for a single, loop-free sequence of instructions. While garden-variety compiler optimizations really just improve 				code (real-world compilers generally cannot produce genuinely optimal code), a superoptimizer's goal is to find the optimal sequence.
					
			as used superoptimization to automatically generate general-purpose peephole optimizers.
